### Derived scope

Pastiera's full virtual keyboard mode uses AOSP LatinIME as a reference for keyboard geometry and visual assets:

- `app/src/main/java/it/palsoftware/pastiera/inputmethod/aospkeyboard/AospKeyboardView.kt`
- AOSP-derived keyboard background, key, spacebar, preview, popup and selected-popup `.9.png` resources under:
  - `app/src/main/res/drawable-mdpi/`
  - `app/src/main/res/drawable-hdpi/`
  - `app/src/main/res/drawable-xhdpi/`
  - `app/src/main/res/drawable-xxhdpi/`
  - `app/src/main/res/drawable-xxxhdpi/`

### Non-derived scope

Pastiera does not import AOSP dictionaries. Suggestions, status bars, prediction bars, IME lifecycle, settings, PKB behavior and custom dictionaries remain Pastiera-specific unless separately documented.

## OpenGameArt Typing Sounds

Pastiera includes short typing sound samples derived from CC0 sound effects.

## Unicode CLDR Emoji Annotations

- Project: Unicode Common Locale Data Repository (CLDR)
- Source repository: https://github.com/unicode-org/cldr-json
- Source path used by generator: `cldr-json/cldr-annotations-full/annotations`
- License: Unicode Data Files and Software License / Unicode License

Pastiera's local emoji search assets under `app/src/main/assets/common/emoji_search/*.tsv`
are generated from Unicode CLDR annotation data by `scripts/generate_emoji_search_assets.py`.
The generated TSV files are filtered to the emoji set bundled with Pastiera and normalized
for compact local lookup.

## Leipzig Corpora Collection / Wortschatz Leipzig

- Project: Leipzig Corpora Collection / Wortschatz Leipzig
- Project pages: https://corpora.uni-leipzig.de/ and https://wortschatz.uni-leipzig.de/
- Companion asset repository: https://github.com/palsoftware/pastiera-dict
- License: Creative Commons attribution terms for the downloaded corpus/frequency-list data;
  the Leipzig frequency dictionary word lists are documented as CC-BY 3.0, while current
  downloadable corpus data may carry corpus-specific terms.

Pastiera's bundled base dictionaries under `app/src/main/assets/common/dictionaries/*_base.json`
and the generated serialized dictionaries under `app/src/main/assets/common/dictionaries_serialized/*_base.dict`
are frequency-list derivatives built mainly from Leipzig Corpora Collection / Wortschatz Leipzig
word-frequency data, with project-maintained filtering, truncation, normalization, and additional
entries. The companion `pastiera-dict` repository distributes larger downloadable `.dict` assets
and their manifests. Conversion and serialization scripts live under `scripts/`.

Provenance note: the maintained dictionary pipeline and current maintainer-provided sources point
mainly to Leipzig/Wortschatz frequency data. Some older bundled entries predate the current
documentation trail, so their exact upstream corpus IDs are not fully reconstructed here.

### Korean (`ko_base.json` / `ko_base.dict`)

- Corpus: Leipzig Corpora Collection, Korean Wikipedia 2021, 1M sentences (`kor_wikipedia_2021_1M-words.txt`)
- Download: https://downloads.wortschatz-leipzig.de/corpora/kor_wikipedia_2021_1M.tar.gz
- License: downloadable Leipzig corpora are provided under Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY). Cite Goldhahn, Eckart & Quasthoff, “Building Large Monolingual Dictionaries at the Leipzig Corpora Collection: From 100 to 200 Languages”, LREC 2012.
- Builder: `scripts/build_korean_dictionary.py` keeps the 50,000 most frequent tokens that contain only Hangul syllables and rank-scales them into the shared 66–222 frequency band.

Pastiera ships the derived word/frequency list, not the corpus sentences.
